Any entities including, but not limited to, live streaming or VOD channels or services, forums or boards, instant messaging or VoIP social platforms, digital or non-digital groups of individuals, etc. may be considered adjacent to Project KONGOR under the explicit consent of the owner of Project KONGOR, with email address project.kongor@proton.me, but are not constituents of Project KONGOR, unless otherwise stated by the owner of Project KONGOR.

Any and all Project KONGOR members that have been or will be added to this organisation are considered to be added by the owner of Project KONGOR, with email address project.kongor@proton.me, either explicitly (by direct invitation) or implicitly (invited by an already-existing member), and any and all intellectual property related to Project KONGOR and created as part of, in association with, or referencing Project KONGOR by any and all past, present, or future Project KONGOR members is owned solely and entirely by the Project KONGOR organisation.

Since the long-term vision of Project KONGOR was and still is to eventually open-source the codebases which make up Project KONGOR, repositories of interest that are part of Project KONGOR are protected by a GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3), meaning that, amongst many clauses, any and all distributions, forks, etc. of Project KONGOR or of any parts of Project KONGOR must be made open-source and any state changes to non-origin codebases must be made public.

The owner of Project KONGOR does not accept any liability incurred by contributions of any members of Project KONGOR, including but not limited to any infringements on the Heroes Of Newerth intellectual property.

Continued membership of Project KONGOR, hosted here at https://github.com/N-E-W-E-R-T-H, is considered to be explicit consent to the afore-detailed terms and conditions.

The owner of Project KONGOR, with email address project.kongor@proton.me, reserves the right to ammend these terms and conditions in any way and at any point in time.
